# Typescript Mutation Testing Kata

This is a port of https://github.com/vmzakharov/mutate-test-kata in TypeScript using https://stryker-mutator.io/. 

# Summary

Passing tests and a having high test coverage might give a false sense of security due to low quality tests. Mutation testing might help to identify these low quality tests and might give a better overview of the quality of the test suite. This coding kata contains a small test suite with a decent test coverage. The task is to identify poorly written tests and enhance those to get a high degree of mutation coverage. 

# Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm run test:mutants
reports/mutation/html/index.html in a browser 
fix failing tests
```
